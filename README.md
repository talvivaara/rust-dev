# Rust development environment

This XML-parser will be an introduction to rust together with databases. We try to implement everything that is required in this repo and goal is to have a working development environment ready with running a one small script.

### Goal of the project

- Everything will be run on top of WSL2, no external machines.
- Deployment should be fully automated.
- All source code will be here.
- Password will be handled with care, nothing is stored on the version control.

<h1> Test cases </h1>
- Test cases to be done later, XML parsing and storing to database.
